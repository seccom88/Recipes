3. Knead into a dough form (Knead your dough tougher than usual, so that there's not too much moisture inside)

4. Cover the dough, let it rest for 1-1.5 hours, until it has doubled in size.

5. Prepare a tray brush on a light layer of oil. place the dough in (do not knead the dough).

6. Place the dough in a pot of cold water leave a spoon in between the lid & the pot so that some of the stream can escape and the dough won't rise too much.

7. Stream on medium low heat. Once the water comes to a boil, stream for 20 minutes. 5 minutes before it's ready, turn the heat to the lowest. Make sure you don't open the lid during the streaming process. After the time is up, let it sit another 10-15 minutes before you open the lid.
