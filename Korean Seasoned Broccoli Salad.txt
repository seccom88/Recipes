1 tablespoon sesame seeds, roasted and crushed (see note)
1 tablespoon sesame oil
1/2 teaspoon minced garlic
salt to taste about 1/2 teaspoon

Instructions
1. Cut the broccoli head from the stem. Cut the head into small florets. Peel the stems and cut into small pieces.

3. Drain, and immediately shock in cold water to stop cooking. Drain well.

4. Combine the broccoli with the remaining ingredients, and toss well to evenly distribute the seasoning.

*In a pan, roast sesame seeds over medium low heat for 4 to 5 minutes. Stir occasionally. Then, crush the seeds in a blender or grounder by pulsing them a couple of times.
