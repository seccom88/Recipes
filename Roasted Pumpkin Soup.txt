Ingredients (servings: 4)

2 3/4 lbs	sugar pumpkin or butternut squash, halved and seeded
1 pc		onion peeled and quartered through the stem
2 pcs		shiitake mushrooms, stemmed, caps wiped clean
1 		garlic clove, peeled
1/2 cup 	olive oil
some		coarse salt and freshly ground pepper
5 cups		homemade or store-bought low-sodium vegetable stock

Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 450 degrees.

2. Cut pumpkin into 2-inch pieces. Combine pumpkin, onion, mushrooms, and garlic on a rimmed baking sheet. Add oil and 2 teaspoons salt; toss to coat, then spread in a single layer. Roast until pumpkin is tender when pierced with the tip of a sharp knife, about 30 minutes, rotating pan and tossing vegetables halfway through. Let cool, then remove skins.

3. Transfer vegetables to a medium saucepan; heat over medium. Pour in 2 cups stock; puree with an immersion blender until smooth. With the blender running, slowly add remaining 3 cups stock, and puree until smooth. Bring soup just to a simmer. Remove from heat, and season with salt and pepper. Cover to keep warm.
