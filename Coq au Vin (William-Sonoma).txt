A traditional dish of Burgundy, coq au vin is perfect for both cozy Sunday suppers and small dinner parties. This version calls for bone-in chicken thighs and drumsticks, which emerge exceptionally moist and tender after long, slow cooking in a Dutch oven.

Ingredients:
1 bottle (750 ml) Pinot Noir
5 fresh flat-leaf parsley sprigs, plus 2 Tbs. finely chopped parsley
3 fresh thyme sprigs
1 bay leaf
1/2 leek (cut lengthwise)
6 oz. (180 g) thick-cut bacon, cut into 1/2-inch (12-mm) dice
2 lb. (1 kg) bone-in chicken thighs
1 1/2 lb. (750 g) chicken drumsticks
Kosher salt and freshly ground pepper
1 lb. (500 g) small button mushrooms
3/4 lb. (375 g) shallots, halved
1 Tbs. unsalted butter
3 garlic cloves, minced
2 Tbs. tomato paste
2 Tbs. all-purpose flour
1 3/4 cups (14 fl. oz./430 ml) chicken broth
3/4 lb. (375 g) carrots, peeled and cut into 2-inch (5-cm) pieces
Directions:
Preheat an oven to 350°F (180°C).

In a large saucepan over high heat, boil the wine until reduced by half, about 15 minutes. Place the parsley sprigs, thyme sprigs and bay leaf against the cut side of the halved leek and tie with kitchen twine. Set aside.

In a Dutch oven over medium heat, cook the bacon until crisp, 10 to 12 minutes. Transfer to a paper towel-lined plate to drain. Discard all but 2 Tbs. of the fat from the pot. Season the chicken with salt and pepper. Set the pot over medium-high heat. Working in 2 batches, brown the chicken, turning once, 8 to 10 minutes per batch. Transfer to a plate.

Discard all but 2 Tbs. of the fat from the pot. Return the pot to medium-high heat, add the mushrooms and cook, stirring occasionally, until they are beginning to brown, 6 to 8 minutes. Add the shallots and cook, stirring, for 2 minutes. Transfer to a bowl.

Reduce the heat to medium and melt the butter. Add the garlic, tomato paste and flour and cook for 1 minute. Whisk in the reduced wine and the broth, increase the heat to medium-high and bring to a simmer. Add the bacon, chicken, mushroom mixture, carrots and bouquet garni. Cover, transfer to the oven and bake until the chicken is tender, about 1 1/2 hours.

Transfer the chicken to a plate. Skim the fat off the sauce, set the pot over medium-high heat and simmer until the sauce is thickened, 12 to 15 minutes. Adjust the seasonings with salt and pepper. Discard the bouquet garni. Return the chicken to the pot. Garnish with chopped parsley and serve immediately. Serves 4 to 6.
