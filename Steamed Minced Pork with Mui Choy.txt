Ingredients

300 g		pork (leg cuts or shoulder, not too lean)
80 g		mui choy
1 tsp		garlic (minced)
2 pcs		ginger (shredded)
2 Tbsp		green scallion

marinate

2 tsp		rice wine
1/2 tsp		sesame oil
2 tsp		cooking oil

Instructions

1. Wash and soak the mui choy for 8 minutes then clean

2. Chop and mince into very small pieces (for about 2 minutes)

3. Hand cut and mince the pork

4. Add salt to the mince pork and hand spin the meat to create texture (for 2 min).
