Honey & Balsamic Air Fryer Brussels Sprouts (forktospoon.com)

Ingredients
1 pound		Brussels sprouts
3 Tbsp		olive oil
1 tsp		salt
1/2 tsp		black pepper
2 Tbsp		balsamic vinegar
2 Tbsp		honey

Instructions
1. Start by dicing your Brussel sprouts, I usually, just cut them in 1/2 unless they are really big, and then I cut them in fourths.
2. Once you have cut all of the Brussel sprouts add them to a large mixing bowl.
3. Add the olive oil, salt, black pepper, balsamic vinegar, and honey, mix well, so all of the Brussel sprouts are covered.
4. Then lay them in the air fryer basket or on the air fryer tray and set the temperature to 350 F for 6 minutes, after about 3 minutes, either shake the basket or toss them with tongs (if you have an air fryer oven) 
5. Plate, serve and enjoy!
