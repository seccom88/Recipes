Crystal Shrimp with Dragonwell Tea (food52)

Ingredients

300 g 		shrimp, (preferably river shrimp, deveined)
1/2 tsp		baking soda (2 g)
1 Tbsp		kosher salt (15 g)
1 		egg white
2 Tbsp		Shaoxing wine (30 g), divided
1 Tbsp		corn starch or potato starch (10 g)
5 g		dried dragonwell tea leaves
1 Tbsp		Neutral oil, such as vegetable or avacodo

Instruction

1. Prepare the shrimp by checking that each shrimp is properly deveined. Wash in cold running water until the water runs clear.
2. Drain and massage in salt and baking soda. Let sit for 5 minutes.
3. Rinse very well in running water to get rid of excess salt and baking soda flavor. Dry the shrimp thoroughly.
4. In a mixing bowl, combine the shrimp, egg white, 1 tablespoon Shaoxing wine, and starch.
5. Mix the shrimp well until the liquids are smooth and emulsified. Continue mixing until the egg white begins to froth and the shrimp feels tacky to touch.
6. In a medium pot, bring water to a bare simmer, about 176°F/80°C.
7. Drop the shrimp into the water and slowly poach, mixing consistently, maintaining a simmer until the shrimp barely turns color, about 1 minute. Remove with a spider and drain.
8. 4. Briefly soak the dragonwell tea: pour hot water from a kettle or a pot over the tea leaves to wet but do not let them open.
9. 5. To finish the dish, heat a skillet or a wok with oil over medium-high heat until shimmering.
10. Add the poached shrimps and toss until coated in oil, about 5 seconds. Add the soaked tea leaves and the remaining Shaoxing wine. Toss and let the alcohol evaporate.
11. Taste and adjust seasoning with salt and sugar if necessary. Serve warm.
