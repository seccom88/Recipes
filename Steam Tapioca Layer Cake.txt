Ingredients

400 g		tapioca starch (1 bag of 14 oz)
450 g		brown suger (1 lb bag)
1 cup		boiling hot water

Instructions

1. Dissolve 1 lb of brown suger with 1 cup of hot water in a large pot (allow room to stir)

2. Add 1 1/2 cup of room temperature water

3. Add 1 bag of tapioca starch to the brown sugar water

4. Hand mix until everything is dissolve evenly

5. Let the starch/sugar batter set aside for 12 hours

Steaming instructions

1. Add a steaming rack to a large wok or large pot.

2. Fill the wok with water, until there’s about a 1/2-inch gap between the water level and the top of the steaming rack.

3. Cover the wok and bring the water to boil.

4. You’ll also need a deep metal pie pan or large metal souffle baker that can fill 6 to 7 cups of liquid.

5. Lightly grease the pan with a neutral flavored oil (like vegetable oil) and set the pan aside.

6. Once the water in the wok boils, carefully place the greased pan over the steaming rack.

7. Give the cake batter a stir because the tapioca flour sinks to the bottom of the bowl, causing separation

8. Pour in the first layer of batter to cover the bottom of the whole pan to create the first layer

9. Steam the first layer for 10 minutes

10. Pour in the next layer of batter over the first layer

11. Steam the next layer for 5 minutes

12. Repeat the next layer and stream for 5 minutes until all batter are gone

13. If the steaming hot water is low, add more boiling hot water

14. After the final layer is steamed, continue to stream the whole cake for another 15 - 30 minutes (It will make it more chewy)

15. Let it cool down and enjoy
