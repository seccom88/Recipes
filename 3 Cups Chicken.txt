3 Cups Chicken

INGREDIENTS
1 Tbsp      sesame oil
2 Tbsp      vegetable oil
6 slices    ginger
5 cloves    garlic (sliced)
1           dried chili (halved)
2 1/4 lbs   chicken wings (cut at the joint where the drumette and the wingette meet, wing tips discarded. You can also use 1 3/4 pounds/800g of pre-cut chicken drumettes and wingettes)
1/4 cup     warm water
1/4 cup     shaoxing wine
2-5 tsp     dark soy sauce
1 1/2 tsp   light soy sauce
2 tsp       teaspoons sugar
Small bunch Thai basil leaves

INSTRUCTIONS
1. Start by putting the sesame oil, vegetable oil, ginger, garlic, and red chili into your wok over medium heat. Let the aromatics infuse the oil for a couple minutes.
2. Then turn up the heat to high, and add the chicken wings to the wok all in one layer. Sear the chicken until golden brown on both sides.
3. Then add 1/4 cup warm water, 1/4 cup Shaoxing wine, dark soy sauce (2-5 teaspoons, depending on how dark you’d like the dish to be), 1 1/2 tablespoons light soy sauce, and 2 teaspoons sugar.
4. Stir and cover the wok. Turn the heat down to medium and simmer for 15 minutes to cook the chicken through (cook for 20 minutes if you want the chicken to be more tender).
5. Then remove the cover and turn up the heat to rapidly reduce the sauce for a few minutes until it clings to the chicken and gives it a rich, dark color. Make sure to stir the chicken during this process to prevent burning.
6. Throw in your Thai basil fry another minute until it’s wilted. Serve!
