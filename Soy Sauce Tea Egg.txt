Tea Eggs (Lee Kum Kee)

Ingredients
6 eggs

Sauce Mix
2 black tea bags
½ cup Lee Kum Kee Panda Brand Premium Cooking Soy Sauce
1 Tbsp. palm sugar
2 star anise
1 cinnamon stick
½ tsp. black peppercorns
2 orange peels

Step 1:
Boil water and once boiled, add in the 6 eggs and hard boil for 10 minutes. Turn heat off and pull the eggs out and remove the water.

Step 2:
Using a butter knife gently tap the egg shells to crack the shells a bit, do it all over but not too much. Do this for all 6 eggs, then place them back into the pot and cover with 2 inches of water.

Step 3:
Add in the tea bags, Lee Kum Kee Panda Brand Premium Cooking Soy Sauce, palm sugar, star anise, cinnamon stick, black peppercorns, and orange peels. 

Step 4:
Bring to a boil, cover and reduce to a simmer for 2 hours. 

Step 5:
Once the 2 hours is up, remove from heat. Place the eggs and liquids in the fridge and allow to soak as you desire. Note: the longer they absorb the liquid, the more flavor the eggs have.
