Handcrafted Braised Pork (Kit Mak)

Ingredients
450g		pork belly (defatted) 
1-2		shallots
1-2 cloves	garlic
1-2 pcs		ginger
200ml		water
3-4		boiled eggs

Sauce:
1 Tbsp		dark soy sauce
1 Tbsp		light soy sauce
2 Tbsp		Shaoxing rice wine
1 tsp		sesame oil

seasoning:
3tsp 5spice powder
2tsp cinnamon powder
1tsp white pepper powder
2tsp cornstarch powder



1-2-3-4 Sweet and Sour Pork Ribs (Ice or rice)

Ingredients
500g 		baby pork rib
1 Tbsp		Shaoxing rice wine
2 Tbsp		soy sauce
3 Tbsp		sugar or rock sugar (37.5g)
4 Tbsp		rice vinegar
1 piece		star anise
1 Tbsp		dark soy sauce
To taste	salt


Instructions
1. In a pot with boiling water, blanch the pork ribs for 3-4 minutes. Drain it well. (Add ginger and rice wine to reduce meat taste)

2. First, remember this principle: hot wok, cold oil. The wok is preheated to high temperature. Add 1 tablespoon oil. Swirl the wok to coat the bottom. Once you see the oil slightly smoking, it's ready to put in pork ribs and keep stirring until it's slightly golden brown.

3. Add rice wine, soy sauce, sugar, and vinegar. Keep stirring till everything is incorporated.

4. Add in HOT water (not cold). This is important. Cold water will make the pork chewy since the temperature is suddenly dropped. Depending on the size of your wok or pot, the water should cover most of the ribs. Reduce the heat to low. Add star anise and cover the wok with a lid.

5. Skim the scum when it's boiling.

6. Keep an eye on the water level. Once it's reduced to 1/3 (after 35-40 minutes), turn the heat to high to thicken the sauce. Remember to keep stirring so the bottom is not burnt.

7. Add in dark soy sauce and stir about 1-2 minutes. The dish is ready to serve! Enjoy!
